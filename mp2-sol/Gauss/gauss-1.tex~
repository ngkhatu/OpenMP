----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Consider a Gaussian elimination method for solving a set of linear
equations. In this problem, you will parallelize it at different 
levels of granularity, and compare parallelism performance between them. 

The code shows a system of linear equations of the following form: 
$Y = AX$, where A is a NxN matrix, and X and Y are Nx1 matrices. 
Focus on parallelizing the upper triangulation step, which is the 
most time consuming step. 

For each of the sub-problem (1)--(3), perform  the following and report the outcome: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Analyze the code. Show the Iteration Traversal Graph (ITG), 
Loop-carried Dependence Graph (LDG) of the code. Then, analyze
the sources of parallelism in the code. State why the loop is parallel or not, and
if it is parallel, show what type of parallelism it has. 
  \item Run the program and report the result that you obtain 
(i.e., the program crashes, or the the value is ...)
  \item Compute how many times the execution enters and exits a parallel section
  \item Measure and report the wall-clock execution time of the program (both sequential
and parallel versions with 2, 4, and 8 threads). 
  \item Estimate the parallel overheads of entering and exiting a parallel section once
  \item Compute the speedup ratios comparing the parallel execution with sequential
execution when (1) the parallel overheads are included, and (2) the parallel overheads
are not included. 
\end{itemize}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item ``for pivot'' loop 
  \item ``for i'' loop
  \item ``for j'' loop
  \end{enumerate}
